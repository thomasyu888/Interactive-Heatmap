# Interactive-Heatmap

This is an interactive heatmap that has hoverover ability and also a zoom feature.  The zoom feature allows you to select an area and zoom into it. However, zoom function only works once! =[

**Clustering.R**

This does all the clustering of the data.  Make sure to input your desired CSV file and made up metadata into the clustering.R file.  This will allow R to give out 4 files that are needed in running the heatmap.
